Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally you can just do "./configure" followed by "make" and "make install", 
and that will install the lxi-control program in your own ~/bin/ directory. If
you want to do a global install, you can do

	$ ./configure prefix=/usr
	$ make
	$ make install

(or prefix=/usr/local, of course).  Just like any program suite
that uses $prefix.
